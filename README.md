# Leetcode Solutions in Java

This repository contains my solutions for Leetcode problems that I resolve occasionally using Java.

Each class represents one problem. For each problem there is a short description and a link to a full description with examples on leetcode. 
If problem requires a custom data structure it is located in the `datastructures` package.

You can find complete list of problems here: https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/
